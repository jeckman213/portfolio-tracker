#### To Get Started Follow These Steps:
1. Clone Repo onto local machine
1. Make sure you have node and npm (node package manager) installed and both are included in PATH
1. `cd frontend` and execute `npm i` to install all of the client-side dependencies described in this package.json
1. `cd ../backend` and execute `npm i` again to install all of the server-side dependencies described in this package.json
1. Now that you're in the backend directory, execute `npm run dev` to start Express and React concurrently (this command must always be executed from inside the backend root). 
1. In a few moments, your default browser should open with localhost:3000 and you'll see a home page placeholder.
