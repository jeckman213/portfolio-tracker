## Portfolio$ Tracking Web Application
#### To Get Started Follow These Steps:
1. Clone Repo onto local machine
1. Make sure you have node and npm(node package manager) installed and included in PATH
1. Run npm i to install all of the dependencies outlined by package.json
1. cd into project folder and type `npm start` into command prompt to start the Express server
1. cd into client folder and type `npm start` into command prompt to start node server. Your default browser should open with localhost:3000 and you'll see a home page (sort of).

__Sometime in the future maybe look into automating starting both servers using somekind of library or command__
