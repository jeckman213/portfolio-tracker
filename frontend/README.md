## Animations

Crossfades between pages and component transitions were created with CSS and the help of TransitionsGroup and CSSTransitions from react-transitions-group.

## Sass & BEM

I used SCSS to make it easier to read instead of one massive file

## Axios

Axios was used to make AJAX calls. 
The Search function on the Stock Quote pages makes use of axios's CancelToken feature.
By caching the searches and using cancel tokens I was able to greatly reduce the number of API calls.

## World Trading Data was used and i left my key in instead of using a .env doesnt matter tbh
